					              <p>The citizens of the city of Ossing have all escaped into the bushes surrounding the city, as the military and fake Amba continue to sow chaos and panic in the town.

Currently, the city is empty, as all the young men and women have skipped town following a raid by the military on Tuesday that targeted all the able-bodied men and women.

The military, which is frustrated after failing to mobilize enough resources for its reckless social activities, showed up in the town and arrested a young man from late General James Tataw’s neighbourhood and took him around the town, obliging him to take them to the bushes where the honest and hardworking citizens of Ossing were hiding.

There is panic all over the place. The young man does not know all the Ossing jungle. Ossing has millions of hectares of forest, some of it being sacred, and it will be preposterous to think that an individual can have sound knowledge of the forest.

Speaking to a resident of the town, Cameroon Concord News Group gathered that the military in Mamfe has the nasty habit of raiding villages and towns when the soldiers are broke.

The military has transformed innocent citizens into its ATM and each time the soldiers are broke, they show up and arrest innocent people who must pay before they are released..</p>

					              <p>Voters in Cameroon will cast their ballots Sunday in a country where the mood has been darkened by separatist violence and calls for an election boycott.

Elections to renew the central African country’s legislature and local councils are taking place for the first time in seven years, after two postponements.

Despite the delays, the campaigning has been low key.

In the capital Yaounde, the few banners put up by the ruling Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (RDPC in its French initials) are barely more numerous than posters calling on people to pick up their litter.

The RDPC supports President Paul Biya, one of the world’s oldest and longest-serving leaders, who has ruled with a steely fist for 37 of his 86 years.

The main opposition party, the Movement for the Rebirth of Cameroon (MRC) is refusing to field a single candidate.

Its leader, Maurice Kamto, spent nine months in jail after his defeat in 2018 presidential elections and is now abroad.

“We could have had a few seats in parliament and some town councillors, but how would that enable us to influence events in Cameroon?” Kamto said in an interview with AFP in Paris last month.

“I would have voted for the MRC but on Sunday I’m going to stay at home,” a young Yaounde voter, who gave his name as Xavier, told AFP..</p>

					              <p>“Where’s the opposition?” was the whimsical question aired by a local RDPC chief, Augustin Tsafack, on the sidelines of a party rally in Yaounde.

The other large opposition party, the Social Democratic Front (SDF), which currently has 18 seats, will take part in Sunday’s vote, going back on a threat to snub it.

							<h3>‘Deathly silent’: Ecologist describes Australian wildfires’ devastating aftermath</h3>
							<p>Australia is in the grip of its worst wildfire season on record. The human death toll stands at 27, and some 2,000 homes have been destroyed across more than 10 million hectares of land — an area larger than Portugal. An estimated 1 billion wild mammals, birds and reptiles have perished.
							<br><br>
							Michael Clarke, an ecologist at La Trobe University in Bundoora, Melbourne, has been studying the effect of fires on native ecosystems — and how they recover — ever since a fire tore through his field site 15 years ago. Clarke spoke to Nature about how animals fare in the wake of wildfires, and why this season’s fires could prove particularly devastating. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00043-2">Read more...</a></p>

							<h3>A new illness, an Earth-size exoplanet and a 12-year prison sentence</h3>
							<p>Researchers have identified a new virus as the cause of a respiratory illness that has affected dozens of people in China, one of whom has died. One case of the virus has also been detected outside China, in Thailand.
							<br><br>
							The pneumonia-like illness surfaced last December, mostly in people who worked at or regularly visited a live-animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00088-3">Read more...</a></p>

							<h3>Imagine a world without hunger, then make it happen with systems thinking</h3>
							<p>“What would the world be if there were no hunger?” It’s a question that the late ecologist Donella Meadows would ask her students at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, back in the 1970s. They found it hard to answer, she later wrote, because imagining something that isn’t part of real life — and learning how to make it real — is a rare skill. It is taught to artists, writers and engineers, but much less often to scientists. Meadows set out to change that, and helped to create a global movement. The result — an approach known as systems thinking — is now seen as essential in meeting big global challenges such as the Sustainable Development Goals.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00086-5">Read more...</a></p>
